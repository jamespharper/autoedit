### editlist
### Contains all edits to be made by autoedit script
###
### Notes:
### - All lines starting with "###" are ignored.
### - All lines starting with "---" are considered to indicate that the
###   following line is the start of a new edit pair.
### - Edits must be input in pairs across two lines, where the first line
###   is the text to be edited, and the second line is the text that will
###   replace the text to be edited.
### - All lines in an edit pair must end with "###" or any other three
###   characters; these will be deleted by the autoedit script. This allows
###   the use of trailing spaces to be used (e.g., differentiating between
###   the words "main" and "maintain")
### - Any blank line will cause the autoedit script to not read any edit
###   pairs below that blank line
###
### BE SURE TO READ THROUGH THE FINAL DOCUMENT AND RUN A SPELL CHECK;
### THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT CREATE ACCURATE EDITS IN ALL SITUATIONS.
###
### BELOW THIS LINE, MAINTAIN THE ORDER DESCRIBED ABOVE AND SHOWN BELOW
