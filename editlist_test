### editlist_test### Contains all edits to be made by autoedit script###### Notes:### - All lines starting with "###" are ignored.### - All lines starting with "---" are considered to indicate that the###   following line is the start of a new edit pair.### - Edits must be input in pairs across two lines, where the first line###   is the text to be edited, and the second line is the text that will###   replace the text to be edited.### - All lines in an edit pair must end with "###" or any other three###   characters; these will be deleted by the autoedit script. This allows###   the use of trailing spaces to be used (e.g., differentiating between###   the words "main" and "maintain")### - Any blank line will cause the autoedit script to not read any edit###   pairs below that blank line###### BELOW THIS LINE, MAINTAIN THE ORDER DESCRIBED ABOVE AND SHOWN BELOW---on the other hand,###conversely,###---besides,###however,###---close to###near###--- main ### primary ###--- moreover, ### ###
