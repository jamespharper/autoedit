### editlist### Contains all edits to be made by the autoedit script###### Notes:### - Each new line represents a new edit pair.### - Edits must be input in pairs, where the first piece of text###   is the text to be edited, followed by an arrow (--->) and the second###   piece of text is the text that will replace the text to be edited.### - All lines in an edit pair must end with "###" or any other three###   characters; these will be deleted by the autoedit script. This allows###   for trailing spaces to be used, which is useful in many circumstances###   (e.g., differentiating between the words "main" and "maintain").### - Any blank line will cause the autoedit script to not read any edit###   pairs below that blank line.###### BE SURE TO READ THROUGH THE FINAL WORD DOCUMENT AFTER RUNNING THE### AUTOEDIT SCRIPT AND RUN A SPELL CHECK; THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT CREATE### ACCURATE EDITS IN ALL SITUATIONS.###### BELOW THIS LINE, MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE DESCRIBED ABOVE AND SHOWN BELOWon the other hand,--->conversely,###close to--->near###don't--->do not###because of--->due to### %--->%###illustrated--->shown###in contrast,--->conversely,###### DUE TO THE BLANK LINE ABOVE, ALL TEXT BELOW THIS LINE### IS IGNORED BY THE AUTOEDIT SCRIPT.
